# Example Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

This section provides several examples of DAGs that are designed for specialized use cases.

* **Dataprep and Autopilot**: creates a project, trains a model, and registers it to DataRobot MLOps.
* **Deployment Prediction Generation**: creates a new deployment from a registered model and demonstrates how to generate predictions from the deployment.
* **Model Training XGBoost**: wrangles Snowflake data, creates a new project, trains an XGBoost model from a selected blueprint, and registers it to DataRobot MLOps for use as a future deployment.
* **Custom Function**: demonstrates how to make and format predictions from a model trained in DataRobot and push the formatted predictions to an external data storage.

Refer to each individual page for more details on each example DAG.
