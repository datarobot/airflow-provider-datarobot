# DataRobot Provider for Apache Airflow

This package provides operators, sensors, and a hook to integrate [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com) into Apache Airflow.
Using these components, you should be able to build the essential DataRobot pipeline - create a project, train models, deploy a model,
and score predictions against the model deployment.

To access other clients and additional information about DataRobot's APIs, visit the 
[API documentation home](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/api/index.html).
